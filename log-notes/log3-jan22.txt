from reading the modelzoo page which has models built for the bdd100k datatset the most appropriate model seems to be the multiple object detections and tracking

Have been following the modelzoo 100k  models to try and develop first neural net

information indicates videos but then uses a different image dataset which should be  subset of the videos

Having difficulty viewing the files and lables ontop

Started to follow QDTrack within modelzoo at https://github.com/SysCV/qdtrack/blob/master/docs/GET_STARTED.md

Had trouble converting labels from bdd100k into coco format as required to run model

Within qdtrack conda env the to_coco.py file required changes in order to match the key name pairs within the label jsons
    - discovered this from the issues page on https://github.com/SysCV/qdtrack/issues and https://github.com/bdd100k/bdd100k/issues/152

Start by continuing QDTrack set up 
    - Aim is to have a root neural net identifying objects mainly pedestrians

Managed to get mmcv version to be correct

Running into issues https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/issues/999

potantial solution is to uninstall pytorch as it was installed via conda which install cpu and gpu usage

will attempt to uninstall and direct download install pytorch

Start by uninstalling pytorch via conda and installing direct from pytorch github to ensure gpu is being used

Spoke with mark and decided to try another exisitng model 

Github: https://github.com/onepoint16/Object-detection-and-segmentation-for-self-driving-cars

I will begin this in February
