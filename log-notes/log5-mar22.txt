Going to create pedestrian detection notebook

Will look to alter so it used DTilaks Perception file as its related to BDD directly

_________________________

6th

Still cant get CV to loop through folder of videos but it works well when passed the video path

Moving on to configuring toi work with perception.py from Dtalik and the BSS labels

Will then look to select individual frames of a video with a pedestrian walking and look too identify and log coordinates


__________________________________________________

7th

Writing script to break video into frames and save to a location

______________________________________________________________

8th 

Trying to feed each frame into model to view and log output of bounding boxes.


______________________________________________________________

10th

Still cant get opon cv to read frames seperatley and run model 

meeting with mark where I will bring this up

Have found image processing DTilaks work so will reference 

https://github.com/TilakD/Object-detection-and-segmentation-for-self-driving-cars/blob/master/object_detection/inspect_model.ipynb

https://github.com/TilakD/Object-detection-and-segmentation-for-self-driving-cars/blob/master/object_detection/Demo.ipynb

to find a solution to reading images and procesing the bounding boxes

________________________________________________________________


11th

Got frames reading speratley and in order

Object detection considers each frame new so no tracking is applied

Will look into this

14th

Spoke to Mark and he states creating a tracking program to track multiple object through busy frames is above this stage in education

Aims are to remove all labels bar pedestrians

2 frames at a time log pedestrians and coordinates 

    Most of the time a pedestrian will be the same in the next frame if the coordinate has moved fractionally

    This would not be the case when a large group of people are walking enar each other

Create dataset from pedestrian movement

logging coordinates and pedestrian

do distance calculation between points 1 and 2

Then look to get agorithm that can predicts 6-10 frames into the future

**For discussion 
    state final programe would need to track targets independantly but until a real system is being implemented this is not possible

15th

- Remove unecessary labels (if possible)

using this stack overlfow to try and reduce classes and class id's
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65810714/mask-rcnn-1-class-only

Error seems to be hit which I think is versioning but will investigate further tomorrow
