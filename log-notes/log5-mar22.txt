Going to create pedestrian detection notebook

Will look to alter so it used DTilaks Perception file as its related to BDD directly

_________________________

6th

Still cant get CV to loop through folder of videos but it works well when passed the video path

Moving on to configuring toi work with perception.py from Dtalik and the BSS labels

Will then look to select individual frames of a video with a pedestrian walking and look too identify and log coordinates

7th

Writing script to break video into frames and save to a location

______________________________________________________________

8th 

Trying to feed each frame into model to view and log output of bounding boxes.


______________________________________________________________

10th

Still cant get opon cv to read frames seperatley and run model 

meeting with mark where I will bring this up

Have found image processing DTilaks work so will reference

https://github.com/TilakD/Object-detection-and-segmentation-for-self-driving-cars/blob/master/object_detection/Demo.ipynb

to find a solution to reading images and procesing the bounding boxes
